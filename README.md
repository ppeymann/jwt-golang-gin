use your string connection in .env file
I used gin framework for api
for getting gin use this command:

```PowerShell
get go -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
get go -u  github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go
get go -u  github.com/go-playground/validator/v10
get go -u  github.com/joho/godotenv
get go -u  go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver

```
